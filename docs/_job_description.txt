About the job
About Turing:

Turing is one of the world’s fastest-growing AI companies accelerating the advancement and deployment of powerful AI systems. 
Turing helps customers in two ways: Working with the world’s leading AI labs to advance frontier model capabilities in thinking, reasoning, coding, agentic behavior, multimodality, multilinguality, STEM and frontier knowledge; and leveraging that work to build real-world AI systems that solve mission-critical priorities for companies. 

Role Overview:

In this role, you will be working on projects to help fine-tune large language models (like ChatGPT) using your strong analytical and english comprehension skills
The ideal candidate should have a solid foundation in Biology, particularly at the level expected in engineering entrance exams, as well as graduate or PhD-level programs.
You should be able to break down complex biological concepts into simple, clear explanations and work efficiently.
The projects will also help you learn how to leverage AI to be a better analyst. This is your chance to future-proof your career in an AI-first world!

What does day-to-day look like:

Design and solve challenging Biology problems to probe the limitations of large language models.
Develop high-quality, step-by-step solutions with clear and rigorous reasoning.
Collaborate with LLM researchers to align problem types with evaluation goals, especially in areas where models typically struggle (e.g., conceptual abstraction, multi-step reasoning, and data interpretation).
Contribute to defining new evaluation benchmarks based on Biology curricula spanning early undergraduate to PhD-level topics.


Requirements:

Analytical Skills: Good research and analytical skills
Feedback Skills: Ability to provide constructive feedback and detailed annotations.
Creative Thinking: Creative and lateral thinking abilities.
Communication: Excellent structured communication and collaboration skills in a remote setting.
Independence: Self-motivated and able to work independently in a remote setting.
Technical Setup: Desktop/Laptop set up with a good internet connection.


Preferred Qualifications:

Candidates pursuing a Master’s/Ph.D./Postdoctoral degree in Biology, Biotechnology, Biochemistry, or a related field are eligible and encouraged to apply.
Ability to analyze and solve complex biological problems with a structured approach.
Ability to explain Biology concepts clearly using simple language, visuals, and simulations when needed.


Perks of Freelancing With Turing:

Work in a fully remote environment.
Opportunity to work on cutting-edge AI projects with leading LLM companies.
Potential for contract extension based on performance and project needs.


Evaluation Process (approximately 80-90 mins) :

Shortlisted candidates will be sent an automated analytical challenge (approximately 30 mins)
Once you clear the challenge, you will be redirected to a Biology assessment (approximately 30 minutes) followed by a language proficiency assessment (approximately 20 minutes).
Once you clear these online assessments, you are ready to go!
